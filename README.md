The objective of this `github` repo was to explore the functionality of `gganmiate` in R. The dataset used in this analysis are also available in 'Data' folder of the repository. File titled as "adult" contains data about the total number of crimes in NYC between 1970-2017. 
The File titled as "nyjob1" contains data about the employment history of various counties in NYC between 1976-2018.
